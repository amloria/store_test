## Install NPM

First, in order to install all the packages needed, once from the "front" folder and once from the "back" folder of the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

Then create a new folder in the "back" folder of the project directory called "images", which will contain two more folders: "products" and "regions".

It will let the app be able to do CRUD operations.

## To run the app in development mode

From the "back" folder of the project directory, you can run:

### `nodemon server`

Runs the backend of the app on PORT=4000 and connects to DB.

From the "front" folder of the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
